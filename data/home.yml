      Prof. Jim Davis, Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, is developing advanced video surveillance systems
      that use computers equipped with video cameras to not only detect the presence of people and track them, but
      also to identify their activities. The research has broad implications for Homeland Security as well as search
      and rescue, border patrol, law enforcement and many other types of military applications. The systems combine
      video cameras with machine learning methods, enabling the computer to perform the kind of visual recognition
      that seems effortless for humans. Davis' work in investigating computer vision methods was recognized by the
      National Science Foundation with the prestigious NSF Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award.
      Support for this research (past and present) has been provided by the National Science Foundation, U.S. Air
      Force, Los Alamos National Lab, U.S. Army Night Vision Laboratory, Intel, and Ohio Board of Regents.
